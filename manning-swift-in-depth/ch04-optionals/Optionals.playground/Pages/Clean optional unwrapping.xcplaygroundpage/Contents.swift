//    let firstName: Optional<String>
//    let lastName: Optional<String>

//: If let statements can be combined with booleans:

if let firstName = customer.firstName, customer.balance > 0 {
    let welcomeMessage = "Dear \(firstName), you have money on your account, want to spend it on mayonnaise?"

//: If let statements can be combined with pattern matching:

if let firstName = customer.firstName, 4500..<5000 ~= customer.balance {
    let notification = "Dear \(firstName), you are getting close to afford our $50 tub!"

//: ## When you're not interested in a value

//: If weâ€™re not interested in the unwrapped value, we can replace it with an underscore.
if
    let _ = customer.firstName,
    let _ = customer.lastName {
    print("The customer entered his full name")
}

//: We can use traditional nil checks
if

    customer.lastName != nil {

}

//: We can perform actions when an optional is nil.
